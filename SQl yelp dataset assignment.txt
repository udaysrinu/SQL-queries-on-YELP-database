Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM table

i. Attribute table =10000
ii. Business table =10000
iii. Category table =10000
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
	FROM table

i. 	Business = id: 10000
ii. 	Hours = business_id: 1562
iii. 	Category = business_id: 2643
iv. 	Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. 	Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi. 	Checkin = business_id: 493
vii. 	Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii. 	Tip = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix. 	User = id: 10000
x. 	Friend = user_id: 11
xi. 	Elite_years = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	I picked Toronto and Food for this question. Yes. The
	restaurants with only 2.5 stars open from 8:00-22:00 on
	Saturday. The places with higher rating stars open late on
	Saturday. 


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

	Yes. The group with 2-3 stars has less review (10) compared with
	the group with higher rating stars.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	No really. They have different locations.

SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT
	business.name
	, business.city
	, category.category
	, business.stars
	,hours.hours,
	business.review_count,
	business.address,
	business.postal_code
	FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = 
	category.business_id) INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id =
	business.id
	WHERE business.city = 'Toronto' AND category.category = "Food"
	GROUP BY business.stars;
		
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+----------------------+-------------+
| name         | city    | category | stars | hours                | review_count | address              | postal_code |
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+----------------------+-------------+
| Loblaws      | Toronto | Food     |   2.5 | Saturday|8:00-22:00  |           10 | 2280 Dundas Street W | M6R 1X3     |
| Halo Brewery | Toronto | Food     |   4.0 | Saturday|11:00-21:00 |           15 | 247 Wallace Avenue   | M6H 1V5     |
| Cabin Fever  | Toronto | Food     |   4.5 | Saturday|16:00-2:00  |           26 | 1669 Bloor Street W  | M6P 1A6     |
+--------------+---------+----------+-------+----------------------+--------------+----------------------+-------------+

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         The ones that are still open have more reviews on
	 average than ones that are closed
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
         There are more business that are still open listed as
	 “useful” or “funny”.
         
SQL code used for analysis:
	SELECT b.name,AVG(b.stars),SUM(b.review_count),AVG(b.review_count),COUNT(r.useful)+COUNT(r.funny),is_open
	FROM business b INNER JOIN review r ON b.id = r.id
	GROUP BY b.is_open
	
	
+------------------------------+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
| name                         |  AVG(b.stars) | SUM(b.review_count) | AVG(b.review_count) | COUNT(r.useful)+COUNT(r.funny) | is_open |
+------------------------------+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------+---------+
| Fiesta Ranchera              |           2.0 |                   4 |                 4.0 |                              2 |       0 |
| Belmont Cleaners and Laundry | 2.96153846154 |                 504 |       38.7692307692 |                             26 |       1 |
+------------------------------+---------------+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------------------+---------+

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
   
	Here I chose to study the preference among different
	types of food on yelp. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

  	I will pick several types of food including
	“Chinese”,”Mexican”,”Korean”,”French”,”Italian”,”Japanese” and
	“Indian”. Then I will analyze their star ratings and number of
	reviews so that I can get some insights on which type of food is
	popular on yelp.                          
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
| category | Number_Of_Resturants |    AVG(stars) | AVG(review_count) | city      |
+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
| Korean   |                    7 |           4.5 |               8.0 | Toronto   |
| French   |                   12 |           4.0 |     135.083333333 | Las Vegas |
| Chinese  |                   13 | 3.76923076923 |     423.230769231 | Las Vegas |
| Mexican  |                   28 |         3.625 |              73.0 | Edinburgh |
| Italian  |                   13 | 3.53846153846 |     78.2307692308 | Montréal  |
| Japanese |                   20 |         3.475 |             22.85 | Toronto   |
+----------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+

         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

	SELECT c.category,COUNT(b.name) AS
	Number_Of_Resturants,AVG(stars),AVG(review_count),b.city
